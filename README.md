# Project Express API

Small intro project to Backend built using Express API. Displaying members of Technigo and Popular books, title and author.

## The problem

I followed the code along in which I created Technigo members and then followed the same principles to create a small endpoint for books as well. This week I decided to meet requirements with minimal effort and time focusing on understanding. The decision ws made plan like this to give more time to focus on final project planning, as well as cacthing up on some previous tech that I don't feel fully comfortable with yet.

There is opportunity to extend the books endpoint significantly which I would have done with more time, or rather if I had chosen to plan my time differently.
